===== Deploy SpringBootApp on Server =====

In Project_Files/SpringBootApp/pom.xml, Increment the version number
	of the build (on line 7)

In Project Root Directory:
$ mvn clean install

Test that it runs
$ java -jar target/jarname.jar

Kill the code running on the server by:
	$ ssh paulmb@proj-309-sb-5.cs.iastate.edu
	$ ps -A | grep java
	This will output something like:
		13785 ?        00:05:03 java
	The first number is the pid (process id)
	$ sudo kill -9 pid

In fileZilla, connect with
	Host: sftp://proj-309-sb-5.cs.iastate.edu
	Username: Net ID
	Password: Net ID Password
	Port: Not needed

Use fileZilla to put the jar on the server in the folder:
	/var/www/html/

Remove the old version of the jar
	$ cd /var/www/html
	$ rm jarname.jar

Run the jar, and disown the process. This is necessary so that
	the process doesn't end when you disconnect the ssh connection.
	The & allows you to keep typing into the terminal as the
	process runs.
	$ java -jar jarname.jar &
	$ disown
