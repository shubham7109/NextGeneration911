Project: 911 User & Responder Tool

This project aims to help a 911-emergency operator to locate a caller in seconds.
Due to the use of outdated technology, more than 50% of the calls made to the emergency response team fails to locate the caller, and this project provides a solution, saving precious lives.

This project can be divided into three major parts:
1.	Windows Application for the 911 Operator to access the caller’s location and information.
2.	An SQL Database and a Web API to help to store information and send the caller’s geographic location, respectively. 
3.	Android App for the user to send the operator information, location when 911 is dialed. 

The features of these parts are discussed below in detail:

Windows Application
•	Ability to retrieve encoded information about the caller from the SQL database.
•	Ability to decode the location of the caller
•	Show the location of the caller in a GUI map using Google Maps public API
•	Should route the call from a mobile phone to the Windows App. So the operator can talk and use the App at the same time. [VoIP]
•	Options to deploy Ambulance, Police, Firefighters etc.
•	Login info to gain access as a 911 responder

SQL Database & Web API service
•	Store important information of the user based in the user’s phone number
o	Name
o	Date of Birth
o	Blood Type
o	Medical History
o	Age 
o	Gender
•	Some kind of API which as capable to connect to the Android device, receive its location and send it to the 911 operator’s Windows application.

Android App
•	Should be basic and user friendly, so users at any age can use it.
•	Large and clear button to dial 911
•	Should be able to find the user’s location and send it to the Web API
•	Option to add information like Name, DOB, Blood Type, Medical History… 
•	SMS verification code to verify user’s phone number during setup. [So we know the user calling is not a robot/scam]
•	Grant access of the mobile features to the app. E.g. Access to location and the dialer.
•	Implement material design but should be quick and responsive, as the app should not waste any time calling 911.
•	The app should automatically set the brightness to high [to prevent accidental calls] and place the call on the highest volume or on speaker.
